					<h3><b>Motherboard Wall Art</b></h3>
					<h5>Making Wall Art out of Broken Motherboards</h5>
					<p class="content" id="data1">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
						During the summer I interned at an electronic repair story. 
						The owner of the story would recycle broken computer parts for his clients. 
						Liking the look of motherboards and other computer parts I decided to go through the recycle pile and take motherboards that looked apealing, 
							with the owners permission of course. 
						I manage to get motherboards from an Xbox 360, an Xbox One, a PS3, a 2008 IMac, a Mac Pro, and one from a 17 year old Gateqay computer.
                    <br><br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
						I decided to attach these motherboards to a piece of plywood painted black, which I would then hang wherever I liked. 
						I currently only have the Gateway, Mac Pro, and PS3 motherboards completed. 
						I recently have debated adding LEDs that are hidden by the motherboards to make the artwork pop out a little bit more, 
							but I have decided to think about doing that afer I finish the rest of the motherboard.

					<h3><b>Arduino Music Box</b></h3>
					<h5>An Arduino Assignment for IB Computer Science</h5>
					<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q3ykSL-PgLk" allowfullscreen>
					</iframe>
					<p class="content" id="data2">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
						Every student in the class had an Arduino kit and we were told to do something with it. 
						I had recenty (and still am) fascinated with music made by things like stepper motors and floppy discs. 
						Becauseos this I decided to use the piezo element in the kit to make music. This would be the first step to stepper motor music. 
						<br><br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
						I luckily was able to find a library that contained a function that all I had to do was insert what note I wanted and its duration. 
						I then pulled up some sheet music and started translating it into the program. 
						It is a very time consuming process but the result was worth it to me. 
						I made a couple full length song programs but then decided to make a program that would cycle through recognisable parts of different songs. 
						Most the songs put into that program are theme songs from video games, movies, and tv shows.

					<h3><b>Local Temperature Recorder</b></h3>
					<h5>Python Webscrapper</h5>
					<p class="content" id="data3">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
						This was another assignment for my Computer Science class and all we had to do was make a webscrapper program in python. 
						I decided to focus my webscrapper and scrapping the current temperature for the city I live in. 
						At the beginning of the program It will query you for how long you want the program to run and at what 
							time intervals do you want to scrape the current temperature. 
						I only had one problem with my program: I could not export it to a spreadsheet. 
						This is because when I was scrapping the temperature, it was also scrapping the degree symbolc which the spreadsheet could not recognise. 
						I tried to find a solution to this but I was not able to with the time I had. 
						Instead it just displays the temperature in the terminal.

					<h3><b>Select-A-Student</b></h3>
					<h5>Program for the Computer Science IA</h5>
					<p class="content" id="data4">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
						Another project for my Computer Science class, except this one is special, this is the Internal Assessment (IA). 
						The only difference between the IA and any other project is the documentation.
						With the IA you need a client and you need to document interaction with them, their reaction to your program, 
							what methods did you use while programmig, etc. 
						<br><br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
						For my IA I decided to make a stand alone Java program that will randomly select a student. 
						This is my first time using Java and it was really fun to learn the basics. 
						Overall I thought my program ended up pretty good for my IA, but there are still a couple things I would like to add or improve. 
						One of those is improving the ability to edit the text file containing student names. 
						My current method is not really effective and could easily be improved. 
						Something else I would like to add is a way to randomize students into groups of either a select size or number.
