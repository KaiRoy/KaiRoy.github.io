        <h2>Current Web Development Skills</h2>
        <p>In a highschool Computer Science class we were tasked with making a protfolio website using 
            <a href="https://kairoy.github.io/">GitHub Pages</a>. Through this I learned the basics of 
            using div as well as basic CSS. I decided to try and do all the CSS design myself instead 
            of using other's CSS code to design my portfolio page. Because of this, my page looks a bit 
            basic in my opinion, but I had fun making it. I tried adding </p>

        <h2>What I Hope to Learn</h2>
        <p>When making my GitHub Pages I had trouble including JavaScript in it, so I would like to learn more about
            JavaScript and how to implement it into my code. I am also excited to learn more about the backend of Web
            Development. I know nothing about it, but it seems like a very interesting topic to learn.

        <p>Yes, I have signed up for Campuswire.</p>

        <h2>Intersting Fact</h2>
        <p>Since middle school, I have been able to solve a Rubik's Cube. I can solve everything from a 2x2 Rubik's Cube
            all the way to an 11x11 Rubik's Cube. On average it takes me about 30 seconds to solve a traditional 3x3 Rubik's
            Cube. I did not figure it out on my own, but I got decently far on my own before using the internet to learn how.
