						In the assignment itself I didn't have any issues, but I had a little trouble 
						when it came to making a CS 290 dropdown on the navbar of my portfolio page. It
						was displaying the dropdown content horizontal and I was able to fix it. It is
						still not lined up how I want it to be but it is close enough that I am going to
						leave it for now.
						<br><br>
						I pretty much knew everything needed to complete the assignment. The already styled
						portfolio website published with GitHub Pages is a bit of a give away. I didn't use 
						many resources in this assignment but in the past w3schools.com has been very helpful.

						I had some issue with the formatting for the main twits. I believe that I would be able 
						to solve the problem, but I put off my coding until a couple of days before the due date.
						This combined with other assignments I needed to do is the reason I didn't finish. 
						<br><br>
						I learned more about Flex Boxes during my experimentation with the twits. While I have made 
						navbars before, this was a different implementation which was interesting to learn/figure 
						out.
						<br><br>
						I didn't use the lecture notes during the assignment, but it probably would have been very helfpul.
						My main resource was w3schools and websites like stackoverflow (miianly stackoverflow).
						<br><br>
						I google flex boxes and navbar implementation using lists instead of divs. The navbar 
						implementation was actually quite similar but there were minor difference that were giving me trouble.
						And I had never used Flex boxes before and I thought that it would be a good way to implement the twits,
						so I had to google how to use Flex boxes. I never got to the part of the lab where I would use @media to 
						change the twit sizes and I probably would haved used google for that part as well. I have some experience 
						with @media but I would have had to do more research to finish this assignment.
