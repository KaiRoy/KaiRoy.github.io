						In the assignment itself I didn't have any issues, but I had a little trouble 
						when it came to making a CS 290 dropdown on the navbar of my portfolio page. It
						was displaying the dropdown content horizontal and I was able to fix it. It is
						still not lined up how I want it to be but it is close enough that I am going to
						leave it for now.
						<br><br>
						I pretty much knew everything needed to complete the assignment. The already styled
						portfolio website published with GitHub Pages is a bit of a give away. I didn't use 
						many resources in this assignment but in the past w3schools.com has been very helpful.
