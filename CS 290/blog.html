						In the assignment itself I didn't have any issues, but I had a little trouble 
						when it came to making a CS 290 dropdown on the navbar of my portfolio page. It
						was displaying the dropdown content horizontal and I was able to fix it. It is
						still not lined up how I want it to be but it is close enough that I am going to
						leave it for now.
						<br><br>
						I pretty much knew everything needed to complete the assignment. The already styled
						portfolio website published with GitHub Pages is a bit of a give away. I didn't use 
						many resources in this assignment but in the past w3schools.com has been very helpful.
                    </p>

						I had some issue with the formatting for the main twits. I believe that I would be able 
						to solve the problem, but I put off my coding until a couple of days before the due date.
						This combined with other assignments I needed to do is the reason I didn't finish. 
						<br><br>
						I learned more about Flex Boxes during my experimentation with the twits. While I have made 
						navbars before, this was a different implementation which was interesting to learn/figure 
						out.
						<br><br>
						I didn't use the lecture notes during the assignment, but it probably would have been very helfpul.
						My main resource was w3schools and websites like stackoverflow (miianly stackoverflow).
						<br><br>
						I google flex boxes and navbar implementation using lists instead of divs. The navbar 
						implementation was actually quite similar but there were minor difference that were giving me trouble.
						And I had never used Flex boxes before and I thought that it would be a good way to implement the twits,
						so I had to google how to use Flex boxes. I never got to the part of the lab where I would use @media to 
						change the twit sizes and I probably would haved used google for that part as well. I have some experience 
						with @media but I would have had to do more research to finish this assignment.

						I had a problem with re adding all the twits when the search is empty. I have a functional version but it
						does not meet the require of it appearing in the same relative order as before. They reappear but the removed 
						twits are now appended to the end. I was not able to resovle this issue and I believe is do to how I implemented 
						the search function.
						<br><br>
						I have attempted a little bit of JavaScript in the past but not a lot and not with any success. This is the first
						time I was able to create JavaScript that was actually functional, so in the end I would say that I learned everything
						I now know about JavaScript.
						<br><br>
						Again, like the previous assignments, w3schools and cites like stackOverflow were very helpful when trying to find a 
						solution to a problem/a method of implementation that was not covered in class. The biggest help, since I knew pretty much
						nothing about JavaScript, was the lecture recordings and the example code from lectures. 
						<br><br>
						I google an implementation of a search function and created my implementation based off of that one. This implementation,
						I believe, is the reason I cannot get my search function to re add the twits in the correct order. I am not sure on this fact,
						but Ihave come to learn with time that there are always multiple ways to implement the samething with programming.

						I would say the topic in general had a learning curve for me to learn. I have done nothing like this before so it was an 
						interesting learning experience.
